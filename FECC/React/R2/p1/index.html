    /*
Note:-
the first challenge I faced was on how ot use the useState as I received the reference error and I was clu less why this was happening, then took the help from chatGPT where it gave me the reason to import the useState Hook from react before I can use it.

Next challenge was on the destructure of useState where i missed on how to do it. Later figured it out.
